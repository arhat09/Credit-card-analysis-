# üìä Sangam Bank Credit Card Project

## üìå Project Overview

Sangam Bank, a legacy financial institution based in Hyderabad, is exploring a new line of credit cards to expand its product offerings. AtliQ Data Services proposed a pilot analysis to help the bank understand key customer demographics and spending insights. This project uses sample data from 4,000 customers to profile key customer segments, identify spending patterns, and recommend credit card features tailored to customer needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps

### 1. ASK
**Stakeholder:** Mr. Bashnir Rover, Strategy Director at Sangam Bank  
**Questions to Address:**
- **Demographic Classification:** Segment customers by age, gender, occupation, etc., and derive insights based on these groups.
- **Spending Insights:** Identify major spending categories and analyze spending by occupation, gender, city, and age.
- **Key Customer Segments:** Define high-value customer segments to target with the new credit cards.
- **Feature Recommendations:** Propose credit card features that align with the spending and demographic patterns identified.

### 2. PREPARE
**Data Source:** [Code Basics Platform](https://shorturl.at/EmieW)  
**Data Structure:**
- **`dim_customers.csv`:** Contains customer demographics.
- **`fact_spends.csv`:** Tracks monthly spending by category and payment type.
- **`meta_data.txt`:** Describes data attributes.

### 3. PROCESS
**Tools Used:**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Microsoft Excel
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Power BI

**Data Preparation Tasks:**
- Removed duplicates and checked for data gaps using Excel functions.
- Standardized location data (e.g., ‚ÄúDelhi NCR‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúNew Delhi‚Äù).

### 4. ANALYZE
**Power BI Analysis Metrics:**
- **Avg. Income Utilization %**: `avg_spends / avg_income`, indicating likelihood of credit card usage.
  
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Annual Expenditure**: `Expenditure * 2`
- **Average Monthly Spend**: Average of monthly spends
- **Customer Count**: Total unique customers
- **Utilization by Payment Type**: e.g., Credit Card, Net Banking, UPI

### 5. SHARE

- **Income Utilization:** Males show higher income utilization at 44.39% compared to females at 39.92%.

2. **Target Audience:** Focus on married males aged 25-34 in IT, particularly in Mumbai, for high-value credit offerings.
